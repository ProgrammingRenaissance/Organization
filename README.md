# Organization
All general support tools for the PR orgamization
=======
This provides a general introduction to the <abbr title='Programming Renaisance'>PR</abbr> environment and the various components that are offered.<br>
PR provides a programming environment that attempts to take advantage of all we have learned about the programming process in the last 80 years.

There are a number of topics that need to be handled in any description of a programming environment. This structure is general purpose and can, in fact, be used outside of the PR environment.<br>
These topics include the following:

## Administration

This section contains everything that is needed to support the administration of PR and that is not covered at a low level.

## Collaborators

A collaborator is someone who has decided to help the PR organization in an way. PR is a public organization so it provides a place for collaborators to say anything that they want about themselves. PR recognizes, however that there are many things that people would like to keep private, so this information is held separately and is under the complete control of the collaborator.<br>
However, what each collaborator gets is effectively a personal website under their full control with both private and public interfaces.

## Configuration

All the data files that contain information about objects or processes in PR and provide quantitive data such as counts or descriptive data such as paths in a filesystem.<br>
Configuration files are all encoded in [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) as frequently such data has structure and JSON is good at describing structure.

## Library

The library is the repository for all executables that provide functionality tp PR but that are not themselves fully executable programs. They contain much functionality that is used throughout PR in products and administrative tools.

## Needs

These are short notes describing something that needs to be implemented in PR. They provide a way of easily saving ideas about future work to be done in PR. Needs always talk about possible future executables.

## Notes

Notes are for saving any type of idea for future reference. They are a primary way of thinking about some subject. They are definitely not polished text but serve as a tool to help develop ideas during design and implementation phases.

## Products

These are the major outputs from the PR organization. They tend to be large multi-functional applications that address major problem areas in the computing world. An example of a product could be the <abbr title='System Amanuensis'>SA</abbr> package that provides a comprehensive suite of system administration tools in a GUI environment. Products make extensive use of the functionality contained in the Library to perform their function.

## README

The README files provide the entry point to all the documentation describing PR products or the PR organization. The file you are reading is the top level file in the entire structure and is accessed directly from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) and indirectly from the PR website landing page. A README file exists in the top directory of each PR component and provides a quick introduction to the component. As formal documentation is created, it is linked from the appropriate README.
